                            During the summer of 2018, I interned at Chubb, one of the largest global providers of insurance.  For the first month,
                            I was paired with the data science team and looked at missing value analysis.  Essentially, every data bricks that we
                            obtain from vendors always have missing values and the team performed an imputation method, called MICE, to fill in 
                            the missing numbers.  I was tasked with validating their method, and in doing so, I implemented Little's MCAR test, which
                            is provides a test statistic indicating whether the missingness is Missing at Random (MAR) or Missing Completely at Random (MCAR).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Additionally, I was paired with the API development team and was given the opportunity to dive into the Azure cloud infrastructure
                            that holds the entire project up.  I got to analyze how the APIs were developed, how they were scaled and stored in the Service
                            Fabric Cluster, and how the data was moved and transferred, from the Data Lakes, Data Warehouses, and Cosmos DB.  The entire
                            end-to-end pipeline was visible and I aided in developing the infrastructure and data flow logic/diagrams for the team
                            to use.

                            In the summer of 2018, I interned at a global firm known as Morgan Lewis & Bockius.  During my time there, I was given
                            responsibility over a large SQL Server Database called InventoryTracker, which acts as a logger for every other SQL 
                            servers and instances.  It keeps track of important information and metadata for other corporate servers, acting as a central 
                            hub for quick reference and documentation.  Now, whenever a new server was created, all of the information has to be logged
                            in the InventoryTracker, which the team did by meticulously modifying and adjusting their old Stored Procedures.  I developed
                            a front-end tool to simplify this process, using C# as the backend to interact with SQL Server.

                            After my freshman year of college, I joined Ericsson, a telecom company, as an intern.  I was given the source code for an 
                            Android application that my team was working on to provide for T-Mobile.  The application served a very similar functionality
                            to the popular Google Survey Rewards, essentially asking users of the network to rate their service.  One of my tasks was to
                            debug and fix a lot of the inconsistencies in the application, such as UI glitches or navigation errors.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Additionally, one of the challenging parts of the application was creating new questions and answers, as this 
                            required parsing through and creating new complication JSON tree structures.  The team manually editted old JSON files 
                            to add to questions to the app.  I simplified this process by creating a simple front-end web app, which 
                            abstracts away all of the JSON editing.
